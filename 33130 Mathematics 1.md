  ### Revision of Angles
**Radians**  
A radian is a unit of angle, where 1 radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc of length equal to the radius.  
There are $2\pi$ radians in a circle, $180^\circ = \pi$ radians, $90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2}$ radians and so on. Radians are used since they result in more natural results and  
formulas compared to degrees which are relatively arbitrary.  
An example of one such formula is the arc-length formula where the length of an arc $s$ is given by $s = r\theta$ where $r$ is the radius of the circle  
and $\theta$ is the central angle.  

To convert from radians to degrees and visa versa you can use the relation $\frac{\text{radians}}{2\pi} = \frac{\text{degrees}}{360}$ and rearrange to $\text{radians} = \frac{2\pi\cdot\text{degrees}}{360}$ or  
$\text{degrees} = \frac{360\cdot\text{radians}}{2\pi}$ depending on what you are trying to convert to and from.  

**Sine and Cosine**  
Sin and cos are trigonometric functions that have a wide range of uses.  
In a right angled triangle the sin and cos functions can be used to relate the ratios between the lengths of the sides to angles.  
$\cos{\theta} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ and $\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$ where $\text{adjacent}$, $\text{opposite}$ and $\text{hypotenuse}$ are the three sides of the triangle relative to the angle $\theta$.  
  
Sin and cos can also be visualised using a unit circle (circle of radius one, centered at the origin), where the coordinates of a point on the edge of the circle are $\left(\cos{\theta},\ \sin{\theta}\right)$ for some angle $\theta$, and as $\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\pi$
the point on the unit circle completes a full revolution counter clockwise, starting and ending at $\left(1,\ 0\right)$.  

There are a number of trigonemtric identities which are very useful to know, some of which are below.
* $\sin^{2}{\theta} + \cos^{2}{\theta} = 1$
* $\sin{(A+B)} = \sin{A}\cos{B} + \cos{A}\sin{B}$
* $\cos{(A+B)} = \cos{A}\cos{B} - \sin{A}\sin{B}$
* $\sin{(-x)} = -\sin{x}$
* $\cos{(-x)} = \cos{x}$
* $\sin{x} = \cos{(x-\frac{\pi}{2})}$
